 Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the
 first 10 terms will be:
 
 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
 
 By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the
 even-valued terms.
